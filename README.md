For each prefix, the following date formats are available:

- `{*.YYYY}` : Year (4 digits)
- `{*.YY}` : Year (2 digits)
- `{*.MMMM}` : Month (full name)
- `{*.MMM}` : Month (abbreviated name)

- `{NAME.L}` : Lowercase filename
- `{NAME.U}` : Uppercase filename
- `{EXT}` : File extension (without dot)
- `{RND}` : Random 8-character hexadecimal string (for unique filenames)

#### Metadata Placeholders

- `{GEO}` : GPS coordinates (format: latitude_longitude)
- `{CAM}` : Camera model
- `{TYPE}` : Media type ('Image' or 'Video')

#### Conditional Placeholders

- `{HAS.GEO}` : 'GeoTagged' if GPS data is available, 'NoGeo' otherwise
- `{HAS.CAM}` : 'WithCamera' if camera model is available, 'NoCamera' otherwise
- `{HAS.DATE}` : 'Dated' if image date is available, 'NoDate' otherwise

#### Example Format Strings

```
"{D.YYYY}/{D.MM}/{D.DD}/{NAME}.{EXT}"
"{HAS.GEO}/{TYPE}/{D.YYYY}/{D.MMMM}/{NAME}_{D.HH}{D.mm}.{EXT}"
"{CAM}/{D.YYYY}/{D.WW}/{TYPE}/{D.YYYY}{D.MM}{D.DD}_{NAME.L}.{EXT}"

These placeholders provide extensive flexibility in organizing your media files based on various criteria such as dates, file properties, and metadata.

## üîç Sophisticated Deduplication

SMO's deduplication process combines state-of-the-art technology with practical strategies to keep your media collection tidy:

### A Unified Approach

SMO treats videos and images equally, allowing it to detect duplicates across formats. By comparing perceptual hashes of frames, SMO accurately identifies duplicates, even in transcoded videos or when an image is a captured moment from a video. Thanks to adaptive frame extraction and resolution adjustment, differences in quality and duration are also handled effectively.

### Step-by-Step Deduplication

1. **Perceptual Hashing**: Generate unique hash signatures for each frame of media files, capturing their essential visual features.
2. **Adaptive Frame Extraction**: Extract key frames from videos using scene change detection, ensuring a balanced representation of video content.
3. **VP Tree Clustering**: Group similar media files using a VP Tree to streamline the deduplication process.
4. **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)**: Compare sequences of frames using DTW, perfect for detecting when one video is a subset of another or when an image matches a video frame.
5. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Use different similarity thresholds for image-to-image, image-to-video, and video-to-video comparisons, ensuring accurate duplicate detection across media types.
6. **Smart File Selection**:
   - **Prioritization**: Files are ranked by duration, metadata completeness, and quality.
   - **Special Handling**:
     - For image clusters, preserve the highest quality image.
     - For video clusters, keep the longest duration video with the best quality.
     - When mixing images and videos, intelligently decide whether to keep both or prioritize based on content and quality.

### Supported Scenarios

SMO is continuously evolving, and we're always working to improve its capabilities and support for various scenarios. If you encounter any specific use cases not covered here, please let us know, and we'll consider them for future updates.

### Leveraging FFmpeg and libvips for Comprehensive Format Support

SotiMediaOrganizer (SMO) relies on the powerful decoding capabilities of FFmpeg and libvips to handle a wide range of media formats. While the default installations of these libraries cover most common formats, you may need to compile them with additional codecs to support specialized or proprietary formats.

#### Expanding FFmpeg Support

FFmpeg is used primarily for video processing in SMO. To enable support for additional video codecs:

1. Download the FFmpeg source code from the [official FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

2. Configure FFmpeg with the additional codecs you need. For example:

   ```bash
   ./configure --enable-gpl --enable-libx264 --enable-libx265 --enable-libvpx --enable-libopus
   ```

   This configuration enables support for H.264, H.265, VP8/VP9, and Opus codecs.

3. Compile and install FFmpeg:

   ```bash
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

Common video formats that might require additional codec support:

- HEVC/H.265
- VP9
- AV1
- ProRes

#### Enhancing libvips Capabilities

libvips is used for image processing in SMO. To add support for more image formats:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies. For Ubuntu/Debian:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libheif-dev libopenexr-dev libwebp-dev
   ```

2. Download the libvips source code from the [libvips GitHub repository](https://github.com/libvips/libvips).

3. Configure libvips with additional format support:

   ```bash
   ./configure --enable-heif --enable-openexr --enable-webp
   ```

4. Compile and install libvips:

   ```bash
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

Common image formats that might require additional support:

- HEIF/HEIC (common in newer iPhones)
- OpenEXR
- WebP

#### Integrating Custom Builds with SMO

After compiling FFmpeg and libvips with extended format support:

1. Ensure the custom-built libraries are in your system's library path.
2. If you're using a package manager like npm or yarn, you might need to rebuild the node modules that depend on these libraries:

   ```bash
   npm rebuild sharp
   npm rebuild fluent-ffmpeg
   ```

3. Restart your SMO application to use the newly compiled libraries.

#### Note on Proprietary Codecs

Some codecs (like H.264 and H.265) may require licensing for commercial use. Ensure you have the necessary rights or licenses when enabling support for these codecs.

By following these steps, you can significantly expand SMO's ability to handle various media formats, allowing for more comprehensive organization of your media collection. Remember that enabling support for additional formats may increase the size of your application and potentially impact performance, so consider enabling only the formats you actually need.

### üèéÔ∏è High-Performance Engine

SMO isn't just effective; it's built for speed:
